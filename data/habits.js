        Description: `The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.

        It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).`
